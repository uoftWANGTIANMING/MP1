## Learning Objectives

Today's focus was on model optimization and hyperparameter tuning, implementing systematic approaches to improve model performance through learning rate optimization, regularization analysis, cross-validation techniques, and model deployment preparation.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Preparation and Model Setup

The session began by loading the preprocessed wine dataset from Day 2 and recreating the LogisticRegression class from Day 3. The dataset was properly split into training (142 samples) and testing (36 samples) sets with stratification to maintain class balance across the three wine types.

```python
# Load cleaned data and separate features/target
df = pd.read_csv('wine_data_cleaned.csv')
X = df.drop(['target', 'wine_type'], axis=1)
y = df['target']

# Standardize features and split data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)
```

### Learning Rate Optimization

We systematically tested different learning rates to find the optimal value for model convergence:

#### Learning Rate Analysis Results
- **0.001**: Training Accuracy 95.77%, Test Accuracy 97.22%, Final Loss 0.4117
- **0.01**: Training Accuracy 99.30%, Test Accuracy 100.00%, Final Loss 0.1474
- **0.1**: Training Accuracy 100.00%, Test Accuracy 100.00%, Final Loss 0.1275
- **0.5**: Training Accuracy 100.00%, Test Accuracy 97.22%, Final Loss 0.1272
- **1.0**: Training Accuracy 100.00%, Test Accuracy 97.22%, Final Loss 0.1272

**Best Learning Rate**: 0.01 achieved perfect test accuracy (100%) with stable convergence.

### Regularization Strength Optimization

We evaluated different regularization strengths to prevent overfitting while maintaining performance:

#### Regularization Analysis Results
- **0.0**: Training 99.30%, Test 100.00%, Weights Norm 2.1691
- **0.001**: Training 99.30%, Test 100.00%, Weights Norm 2.1501
- **0.01**: Training 99.30%, Test 100.00%, Weights Norm 1.9950
- **0.1**: Training 98.59%, Test 100.00%, Weights Norm 1.2483
- **0.5**: Training 98.59%, Test 100.00%, Weights Norm 0.6286
- **1.0**: Training 97.89%, Test 91.67%, Weights Norm 0.4185

**Best Regularization Strength**: 0.0 (no regularization) achieved optimal performance, indicating the model was not overfitting on this dataset.

### L1 vs L2 Regularization Comparison

We conducted a detailed comparison between L1 and L2 regularization techniques:

#### Regularization Type Analysis
- **L1 Regularization**: Test Accuracy 100.00%, Final Loss 0.2040, Weights Norm 1.9467
- **L2 Regularization**: Test Accuracy 100.00%, Final Loss 0.1474, Weights Norm 1.9950

Both regularization types achieved perfect test accuracy, but L2 showed slightly lower final loss. The weight distributions were visualized to demonstrate the different regularization effects on model parameters.

### K-Fold Cross-Validation

We implemented comprehensive cross-validation to assess model robustness across different data splits:

#### Cross-Validation Results
- **3-Fold CV**: Mean Accuracy 97.75% ± 0.81%, Range 96.61% - 98.33%
- **5-Fold CV**: Mean Accuracy 97.76% ± 2.08%, Range 94.44% - 100.00%
- **10-Fold CV**: Mean Accuracy 97.78% ± 2.72%, Range 94.44% - 100.00%

**Best K-Fold Value**: 10-fold provided the highest mean accuracy (97.78%) while maintaining reasonable standard deviation.

### Model Deployment Preparation

We implemented multiple model saving and loading methods for production deployment:

#### Model Persistence Methods
1. **Pickle Serialization**: `best_logistic_regression_model.pkl`
2. **Joblib Serialization**: `best_logistic_regression_model.joblib`
3. **Parameter Export**: `model_parameters.npz`

All loading methods were verified to produce identical predictions, ensuring deployment reliability.

#### Final Model Performance
- **Training Accuracy**: 99.30%
- **Test Accuracy**: 100.00%
- **Cross-Validation Accuracy**: 97.78%
- **Final Loss**: 0.1474
