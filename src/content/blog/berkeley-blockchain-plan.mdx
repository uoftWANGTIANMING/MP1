## Overview
I have enrolled in two UC Berkeley edX courses:  
1. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies  
2. Blockchain Technology  

Objective: finish both in 5 weeks, build a working blockchain project, and document the entire process on my blog and GitHub.

## Week-by-Week Plan

### Weeks 1–2: Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies
- Blockchain fundamentals  
- Bitcoin architecture and workflow  
- Consensus algorithms (PoW) and security principles  

**Deliverables:**
- Blog post: "How Bitcoin Works"  
- Technical diagram of blockchain fundamentals  

---

### Weeks 3–5: Blockchain Technology
- Ethereum fundamentals and smart contracts  
- DApp development workflow  
- Blockchain applications: DeFi, supply chain, etc.

**Deliverables:**
- Smart contract deployed on Ethereum testnet  
- Minimal functional DApp with documentation  
- GitHub repository with source code and setup instructions  

---

## Execution Strategy
1. Complete all course modules and assignments on edX.  
2. Maintain ≥70% score in quizzes and projects to qualify for certificates.  
3. Convert coding exercises into open-source projects on GitHub.  
4. Publish 1–2 blog posts per week summarizing technical insights.  
5. Update LinkedIn profile after certificates are awarded.

## Next Steps
- Research Zero-Knowledge Proofs and on-chain identity.  
- Study Layer 2 scaling solutions and interoperability protocols.  
- Contribute to open-source blockchain projects.
