## Learning Objectives

Today's focus was on conducting deep result analysis and generating comprehensive insights from our wine classification model. The session involved detailed performance evaluation, feature importance analysis, model confidence assessment, and preparation for the final report of Week 1.

## Technical Implementation

### Data and Model Loading

The session began by loading the preprocessed wine dataset and the optimized logistic regression model from Day 4:

```python
# Load preprocessed data
data = pd.read_csv('wine_data_cleaned.csv')
X = data[original_features].values  # 13 wine features
y = data['target'].values

# Load best model from Day 4
with open('best_logistic_regression_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    best_model = pickle.load(f)
```

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Features**: 13 wine chemical properties
- **Samples**: 178 wine samples
- **Classes**: 3 wine types (Class 0, 1, 2)
- **Model**: Optimized logistic regression with 13 input features

### Model Performance Analysis

We conducted comprehensive performance evaluation using the test dataset:

#### Overall Performance Metrics
- **Training Accuracy**: 98.59%
- **Test Accuracy**: 100.00%
- **Final Training Loss**: 0.1474

#### Detailed Classification Report
